This code is intended to work with the libPyAI version that is included. This version is patched in order to allow setting up and down the ship shield. The behaviour of libPyAi.shield() is to 'toggle the space bar key'. Also, the hisory.csv file contains data stored from recorded games and is needed for classifier training.
All other files are source code. The main file to be run (with python3) is pilot.py. It is currently set up to play in a localhost server. The startup can take a while since the classifier needs to be trained.
